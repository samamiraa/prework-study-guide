        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html : This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
     <li>Inside HTML tag, attribute lang="en" will state what language web page will be in. In this example "en" is for English.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage called Metadata.</li>
          <li>Inside the head tag the following metadata tags can be found: Title, Style, Base, Link, Meta and Script.</li>
          <li>Title element defines title for the webpage. This is required and important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>Style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>Base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>Link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>Script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
<li>Body element has many tags that can be used including h1 - h6 (level of heading), p (block of text), ul (unordered lists), ol (ordered lists), li (list items), img (info about images) which can include attributes ie. `src` (important - defines location) or `alt` (contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image), br (creates empty line or break between two blocks of content). </li>
<li>a href= - a : anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. Href: attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
<li>Footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>       
</ul>
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS: style element directly in HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Useful for quick permanent changes, less flexible than external/internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change. </li>
<li>Internal Style Sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file using `style` element. Rules only apply to that page and can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
<li>External CSS Style Sheet: Preferred method because it allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a seperate sheet. File is linked with `link` element placed in HTMLs `head` element. </li>   
<li>Declaration: contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>    
<li>Margin Property: property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. When set to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li> 
<li>Padding Property: adds space around the content inside an element. When padding is increased, makes element bigger because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
<li>Wild Card Symbol or * is used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
<li>Two selectors can be combined into one CSS rule by seperating selectors with a comma.</li>
<li>Link element: creates connection to external file. Rel Attribute: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource. href attribute: specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. </li>
<li>Card: designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>git checkout main: switches to main branch</li>
    <li>git add -A: add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
    <li>git commit -m "add starter code": commits staged files with a commit message that describes what the commit contains. -m flag to associate a message with our commit. </li>
    <li> git pull origin main: git (identifies git command), pull (receive a branch's modifications into the local environment), origin ( indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo), main (indicates the branch).</li>
  <li>It's important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
<li>git push origin feature/starter-code: the push command pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. You can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>
