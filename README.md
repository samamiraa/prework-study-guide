# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I have been wanting to learn how to code for years and now that I have a daughter, she has been my motivation to start. I built this project to get a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. This will help me with an exciting career change once I acquire the knowledge and skills to create more projects in the future. In this introductory project, for HTML, I learned the different elements and their definitions. For CSS, I learned about different style sheets and made the webpage more visually appealing. For Git, I learned about the different git commands and about git version control. Lastly, for JavaScript, I learned different terminology and how to test code in Chrome DevTools.

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide, there are 4 sections that are titled HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Each section has notes regarding each topic. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. When you open the console, it will list the topics we learned from Prework and it will randomly choose a topic for you to study first.
